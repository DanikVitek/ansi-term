# zig-ansi-term

![CI](https://github.com/ziglibs/zig-ansi-term/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Zig library for dealing with ANSI Terminals (escape codes, styles, etc.)

This was originally code which was extracted from
[zig-lscolors](https://github.com/ziglibs/zig-lscolors) for use in
other zig libraries. More features have been added since.
